This solution consists of many different basic microservices, all are built following the Clean Architecture and DDD (Domain Driven Design) pattern, which use/demonstrate many different concepts (or building blocks) of ASP.NET Core REST APIs.

I have chosen an apt use case related to the ongoing pandemic, the “mass vaccination program” to demonstrate the fundamentals. Basically, my solution consists of few possible APIs to run a mass vaccination program (by a small organization/institute or a State for example) in an organized way, may not be that efficient though. Also, the client apps are not part of this solution. It shows how the backend can be handled and if suitable, then the client apps (web app, mobile app etc.) can be created to consume these backend services to efficiently manage the vaccination program.  

All projects are built on ASP.NET 6 minimal hosting model using Visual Studio 2022.
